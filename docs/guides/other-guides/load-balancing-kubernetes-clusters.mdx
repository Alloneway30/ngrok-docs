We have another guide showing more explicitly how to add [individual K8s
services](/docs/guides/others-guides/load-balancing-kubernetes-services) with
ngrok custom resources, Ingress objects, or Gateway API resources. This guide
focuses on load balancing multiple Kubernetes services, all deployed on more
than one cluster, behind a single hostname.

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

Check out our [installation instructions](/docs/k8s/installation/install/) for
details on how to use Helm to deploy the open-source Operator to each cluster
you'd like to load-balance between.

## 2. Create internal Agent Endpoints on your first cluster

:::note
This shows how to create internal Agent Endpoints using our [custom
resources](/docs/k8s/using-crds)â€”check out our
[Ingress](/docs/k8s/using-ingreses/) or [Gateway API](/docs/k8s/using-gwapi)
guides to adopt an existing implementation to multi-cluster load blancing.

Repeat the process on any other clusters you want to load balance traffic
between.

## 4. Create a Cloud Endpoint

## 5. Add routing to your load-balanced endpoints with Traffic Policy
